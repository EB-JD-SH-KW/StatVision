For this project, I was responsible for developing and testing the user search feature, implementing the visualization of returned data, and building the front-end for these components. I also helped load the database with NBA team and player statistics, as well as MLB team statistics. In addition, I implemented exception handling to ensure the search feature handled errors gracefully. These tasks allowed me to build on skills I identified in my initial assessment last Fall, including full-stack development and database setup and retrieval. Working on both the front-end and back-end of the search feature gave me practical experience in full-stack development, while helping to populate the database improved my understanding of SQL and database management. I also applied my strengths in Python while setting up Django back-end functionality and used project planning and testing skills learned in Software Engineering to structure my work effectively.

To make the search feature more flexible for users, I implemented an AI-powered SQL query generator using the OpenAI API. I provided the model with the structure of our database, which allowed it to translate user input into meaningful SQL queries. I developed the front-end interface, back-end logic, and middleware API to connect everything, which helped me gain a deeper understanding of how different parts of a web application communicate. This project strengthened my competencies in full-stack development, API integration, SQL, and exception handling. A key success was creating a dynamic and user-friendly search experience that returned accurate, visualized results. A major obstacle was ensuring that AI-generated queries were valid and secure, which required additional logic for sanitization and handling edge cases in user input.
