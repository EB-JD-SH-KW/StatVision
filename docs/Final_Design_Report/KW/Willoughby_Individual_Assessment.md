# Individual Capstone Assessment


## Introduction

As a Computer Science student at the University of Cincinnati, I am excited to embark on a senior design project to develop a web or mobile application that tracks and scores team and individual statistics and records in sports. This project presents an opportunity to merge my passion for software development with my interest in data analysis and sports. The goal is to create a user-friendly platform aggregating sports data and providing meaningful insights through analytics and visualization tools. By leveraging my full-stack development and data management skills, I aim to enhance how fans, coaches, and analysts interact with sports statistics. This project aligns with my career aspirations in software engineering and data analysis, offering a practical application of concepts I have learned throughout my academic journey. It also allows me to showcase my abilities in building data pipelines and developing intuitive user interfaces.


## College Curriculum

My college curriculum has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science principles and practical programming skills essential for this project. Courses, such as CS4092: Database Management, taught me how to design and manage relational databases, which is critical for storing and retrieving vast amounts of sports data efficiently. In CS3003: Introduction to Programming Languages, I learned how to approach new programming languages and technologies—a skill invaluable as we select the appropriate tech stack for our application. EECE3093: Software Engineering introduced me to the software development lifecycle and agile methodologies, guiding our project's planning and execution phases. Additionally, AMEC-2050C: Web Development provided me with hands-on experience in building responsive websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring our application's front end will offer an intuitive user experience. These courses have honed my technical abilities and developed my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to work collaboratively.


## Co-op Experiences

My co-op experiences have further prepared me for this project by providing real-world applications of my classroom skills. As a Software Engineer Co-Op at Henny Penny, I developed automated data analysis programs to analyze data and aid in fault detection for component failures. This process enhanced my Python and Bash scripting proficiency and deepened my understanding of data pipelines and automation—skills crucial for handling sports statistics data. As a DevOps Engineer Co-Op at Henny Penny, I implemented and maintained CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, improving my knowledge of software deployment and version control systems like Git. These experiences strengthened my teamwork, communication, and time management abilities as I collaborated with cross-functional teams to streamline processes and reduce manual tasks. I plan to utilize these technical and non-technical skills to ensure efficient development, adherence to best practices, and meeting user needs.


## Project Motivation

I am motivated to participate in this project because it combines my interests in software development, data analysis, and sports. Creating an application that enhances how sports data is consumed and utilized is especially exciting as it could benefit fans, analysts, and professionals. I expect our project will result in a functional application that efficiently tracks and displays sports statistics, providing users with valuable insights and an exceptional experience. I will consider the project successful when it meets all functional requirements, performs reliably, and receives positive feedback from test users. A crucial measure of success will be the ability to present the application as a professional project to potential employers. Ultimately, I will know I have done an excellent job when I feel genuinely proud of our accomplishments and confident in the quality of the solution we have developed.


## Preliminary Approach

Our preliminary approach involves determining the most suitable technology stack to handle real-time data processing and provide a seamless user experience. Given my web development and database management background, I propose leveraging frameworks like Django or Flask for the back end, paired with a robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL. We could utilize React or Angular for the front end to create an interactive and responsive interface. We will also need to integrate APIs for real-time sports data or develop web scraping tools if necessary. I plan to apply these technical and non-technical skills to design our project efficiently, follow best practices, and meet user needs. We will employ agile methodologies throughout the development process to iteratively develop and refine the application.
