# Senior Design Self Assessment

## Contributions

I led most of the front-end development work for our website, focusing on creating a responsive and user-friendly interface. I set up the Django framework to ensure that our backend was efficient and robust. I also developed reusable templates to maintain a consistent design and streamline the development process. Additionally, I configured a local database to securely store user credentials, which further enhanced our application's reliability.

Beyond the initial development, I improved our deployment process by creating a Docker Compose file that enabled single-command deployment. I integrated GitHub Actions to automatically deploy our web application to a remote AWS server whenever repository changes were made. These efforts not only optimized our workflow but also deepened my understanding of automation and CI/CD practices. Although I encountered challenges in aligning new deployment strategies with project requirements, these experiences significantly contributed to my professional growth and technical competencies.
