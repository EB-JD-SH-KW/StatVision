My individual contribution centered around the extraction, transformation, and loading of hundreds of thousands of rows of sports data, ranging from 1870 to 2025. Some other specific tasks I assisted on include building the database context to feed OpenAI API, the general process of turning user queries into real-time results to satisfy the users, and some front-end development, such as the team pages on the website. I also ran the process of launching the siteâ€™s EC2 instance and database registration on AWS. Overall, I would estimate 45-50 hours spent individually on the project development this spring.
