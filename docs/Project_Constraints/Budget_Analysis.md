# Budget Analysis
At this point, our project has not required any spending or need for a budget. In the future, it is not certain that we will be able to complete the project without the need for a budget, but our goal is to utilize as many open-source tools and methods as possible to store and use our data as we need for the application. This will include utilizing free credits from cloud-based applications.  

Although financial restrictions may restrict the functionality of our project, we still believe it will have a great impact on our professional development. Creating a full-stack web application is a great opportunity to learn new skills in areas such as database management and SQL while improving on areas that we already have experience in from our past co-op opportunities and courses. This project will allow us to gain and improve on skills that are important for full-stack development. Additionally, successfully delivering this project will allow us to gain confidence in our abilities and will be a great addition to our resumes for my job search.
