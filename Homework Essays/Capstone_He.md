# Individual Capstone Assignment 

For my senior design project, we will be developing a web application that provides access to specific player and team data from professional sports leagues across multiple seasons. As a Computer Science student, this project allows me to merge my passion for sports with my technical knowledge. The goal is to build a platform that enables users to analyze trends, compare statistics, and gain insights into sports performance over time. This project will allow me to apply skills I’ve gained both in the classroom and in hands-on environments. It also provides an opportunity to contribute something meaningful to the sports analytics community. Ultimately, this project combines my academic background with a personal interest that keeps me engaged and motivated.

My academic curriculum has provided me with a strong foundation in computer science, which is essential for developing this project. Courses such as CS 2021: Python Programming and CS 2028: Data Structures taught me essential programming skills and how to organize and manipulate data efficiently. These concepts will be crucial when working with large datasets of sports statistics. Additionally, AMEC 2050: Web Design I provided me with the knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I will use to design a user-friendly interface for the web app. Finally, EECE 3093: Software Engineering equipped me with software development methodologies, such as agile, and best practices for managing a project from start to completion. These technical courses have prepared me to handle the design and implementation aspects of this project. 

Although I haven’t participated in a traditional co-op, I have taken 2 semesters of the Engineering Education Program (EEP), which offered me valuable exposure to real-world applications of my academic knowledge. Through EEP, I completed online courses that enhanced my understanding of key technical topics such as data management, web development, and software design. These courses strengthened my coding skills and introduced me to new tools and frameworks that I will apply in this project. Additionally, these experiences developed my time management and self-discipline, as I had to independently pace myself and complete courses within deadlines. The combination of technical and non-technical skills gained through these courses has equipped me to succeed in this project, even without formal co-op experience. 

I am particularly motivated to participate in this project because it aligns with both my academic interests and personal passion for sports. The idea of creating a tool that can help sports enthusiasts, analysts, and even teams make data-driven decisions seems fun to me. For my preliminary approach, I will begin by building the core functionality using C# WebMVC to connect the front-end and back-end, with SQL for managing player and team data. I will test the system with smaller datasets to ensure everything functions properly before scaling up. After confirming that the core features work, I will focus on optimizing performance, especially for handling larger datasets and traffic. Finally, I will create a front-end interface that is user-friendly and intuitive. I expect that the results of this project will be a fully functional web app capable of providing comprehensive sports data analytics. 

To evaluate my contributions to this project, we will establish clear milestones for each phase of development and measure my progress against these goals. Success for me will be defined by the project's completion and by the quality and efficiency of the solution I develop. I will consider the project complete when the web app runs smoothly, processes large datasets without performance issues, and offers an intuitive user experience. A key indicator of success will be whether users can easily access and interpret the sports data to generate meaningful insights. Ultimately, I will know that I have done a good job when the web app meets these criteria and is useful for its intended audience.
