Over my academic career, I have been aiming to use my Computer Science degree to
pursue becoming a data analyst or a software engineer. This project will allow me the ability to
display my skills in both, adding to my resume a project displaying skills in building a data
pipeline and creating an easy way to access such data. I’ve been looking for a good opportunity
to add to my resume and being able to display most of the skills for my target job opportunities is
what I have been looking for. This project will also allow me to gain more experience in a fullstack environment. Learning and applying code to make all sides of the project move will be a
great academic experience for me.

Over my college career, there have been several classes that have given me the skills
necessary to complete this project. These classes include EECE3093, CS3003, CS4092, and
AMEC-2050C. CS3003 taught me how to approach learning and writing code with new
programming languages, which from experience is something that will likely happen with this
project. CS4092 taught me how to build and manage databases, something that will end up being
the center of our project. AMEC-2050C taught me how to design high quality websites to give
our end user a positive experience. EECE3093 put everything together, giving me the
opportunity to work on a similar yet smaller project to see what the process is like, so I am more
prepared for this one.

A couple of my Co-Ops have given me great experience and skills that will help me
accomplish our goals. First, as a QA Data Analyst Intern with Scheduler AI, I frequently had to
analyze tables of data, and form strategies as to which kinds of data would give us the best
analysis of our AI’s performance. From this, I also learned how to write scripts for databases,
something that will be useful for this project. I can apply this knowledge by making sure our
users find exactly what they are looking for when using our project. At my second Co-Op with
Martin & Associates as a Sage Consultant Co-Op, I was much more hands-on into the world of
code, completing several projects such as a Web API, a separate website for communicating with
the API, and wrote processes automating several tasks within Sage. These general coding skills
will give me the tools I need to build our project from the ground up.

I am incredibly motivated and excited to participate in this project. Our preliminary
approach to designing a solution is first figuring out what our stack will be. We will need to
ensure we have all the tools for the job, and this includes needing a form of middleware to ensure
our front-end and back-end tools can properly communicate. The expected result for this
semester is to at least get a working and fully stored database that end-users can interact with and
find key data in sports history at their fingertips. Although we have agreed to set the bar a little
lower in favor of quality, I think what I would consider a success is starting to show us
expanding beyond that at the end of the project.

It is important to set ourselves up to innovate our data and build on this project going into
the following semester. I believe I will consider our team’s work a good job as soon as it’s
something I am proud to show a potential future employer in an interview. I want to feel
genuinely impressed about my accomplishments, especially considering we aren’t particularly
aiming high with our official final goal. As we're about to approach the beginning of our
professional lives it is more important to show off something a professional would use for their
business. I believe these are important skills to have and build as we move onto the next stage of
our career.
