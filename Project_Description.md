## Project Topic Area:

Sports Data Collection and Analysis

## Project Abstract

Our project aims to create a dynamic sports tracking and analytics platform for casual fans, fantasy sports players, and analysts. Fans can view real-time stats for teams and players, while fantasy users access data for roster decisions. Analysts benefit from league-wide data. By blending real-time updates and analytics, the platform delivers actionable sports insights for all users. 

## Problem Statement

There are massive amounts of data generated across many different sports leagues each season. This data is desirable for fans
and analyst across a variety of leagues, and these leagues often have their own first or third party website. Additionally, any website that does offer multiple sports leagues typically has a paywall, or has a complicated user interface. 
This project aims to solve this problem by organizing data across a variety of sports leagues so fans can access their desired data for their favorite teams in one place with a simple and clean user interface. Casual and die-hard fans can both find their desired data with just one search. 

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions
Statmuse is one of the most used sports statistics websites due to its ease of use and variety of sports covered, but has a paywall for finding advanced statistics and only allows a threshold of free searches per day. 
There are many websites which offer free unlimited data retrieval on sports statistics across many leagues, however many of the websites only focus on one league. These league focused websites such as basketball-reference.com, seem to have busy user interfaces with many different pages and filtering options that can confuse casual users.
