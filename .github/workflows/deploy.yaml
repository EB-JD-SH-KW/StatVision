# This GitHub Actions workflow file deploys the latest commit to a remote server.
#
# Functionality:
#   - The workflow triggers on push events on any branch that contains this file.
#   - It checks out the repository code and connects to a remote server via ssh.
#   - It updates the repository to the commit that triggered the workflow.
#   - It then runs docker compose to deploy the latest code.
